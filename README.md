# MegaBuyte 

MegaBuyte aims to streamline shopping by eliminating long lines and tedious checkout processes. Customers would add items to their
cart by scanning the barcode of the desired item using their phones. By passing a checkpoint, customers would automatically checkout
and pay for their items with a connected bank account (using CapitalOne's Nessie API). Participating stores would be able to
view and maintain databases of their products to track purchases and ensure no theft has occurred. 

This project was created during HackTJ 2016 using PhoneGap, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQLite3.
